# someQs: Something Quantum
## Description

Contained within is all of someQs' experiments so far in the
field of quantum computing. We don't yet know where the
experiments should lead but we are starting to develop some
in house intellectual property.

## Dependencies

All you need to start tinkering is python3.5 or later and qiskit.
Install qiskit with 'pip3 install qiskit' on your favorite Bash
Shell.

## Research

This folder more has to do with experiments centered around
traditional architecture ontop of Qubits. It includes many
examples of Quantum Code and as the timestamps progress into
the present, the files show how SomeFramework is built.

## Experiments

The experiments folder is centererd around trying to determine
what is possible with a Quantum Computer and its various gates
without, for the most part, the mixing in of traditional
architecture.

## Usage

Run 'python3 name_of_file.py'
