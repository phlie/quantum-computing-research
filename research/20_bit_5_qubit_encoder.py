# This is a quantum program that encodes 20 bits in four Qubits and decodes them
# to change how many 4 bit Octs to include, just change the value of num_qubits.
# The bits that it encodes are choosen randomly but the program could be modified
# to pass data through the multiverse, if you want to increase the number of bits
# encoded total, then you can use more Quantum Circuits by simply making the loops
# variable bigger, it only works in Quantum Words of length 20 but those can be
# combined to form bigger outputs
